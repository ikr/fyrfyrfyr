# About

Basic tools for composing functions, to write simpler and safer programs in PHP 5.4+. Heavily
inspired by [@drboolean](https://twitter.com/drboolean)'s
[book](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/content/), the
[Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) library, and the
[Fantasy Land](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land) JS project.

# Why?

This library grew out of frustration with old PHP code I have to maintain. I'm convinced that
functional programming can lead us [Out of the Tar Pit](http://shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf). I
do know about [Phamda](https://github.com/mpajunen/phamda) and
[Pramda](https://github.com/kapolos/pramda); very cool projects, but they both require PHP
5.6+. Then, I was also not 100% on board with some design choices those 2 make. I'd like to keep
fyr-fyr-fyr tiny and lean, without excessive magic.
